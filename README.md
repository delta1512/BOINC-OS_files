# BOINC OS Repository

## What is BOINC OS?

BOINC OS is a customised operating system tasked with the sole purpose of performing distributed/volunteer computing using the Berkley Open Infrastructure for Networked Computing [BOINC](https://boinc.berkeley.edu). BOINC OS's goal is to be run on a USB and be able to boot into any type of hardware in order to use the computer for scientific compute tasks. It is a linux-based operating system built upon [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org).

Find more information [on our website](https://delta1512.github.io/BOINCOS/).

**The purpose of this system is to:**

- Make the process of setting up an operating system to perform BOINC computing as easy as plugging in a USB.

- Deter the usage of a proprietary and often paid solution in order to prove the versitility, simplicity and adaptability that Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) has in the modern environment.

- Achieve a greater efficiency by removing the majority of the unneeded software and running processes that other solutions are bloated with, having a purely dedicated system and contributing to efficiency.
