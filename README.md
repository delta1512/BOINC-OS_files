# BOINC-OS_files

Repository for the collection of customised files and documentation used in the creation of BOINC-OS

## What is BOINC-OS?

BOINC-OS is a customised operating system tasked with the sole purpose of performing distributed/volunteer computing using the Berkley Open Infrastructure for Networked Computing [BOINC](https://boinc.berkeley.edu). BOINC-OS's goal is to be run on a USB abd be able to boot into any type of hardware in order to use the computer for compute tasks.

## Where can i get it?

BOINC-OS is currently being developed so that it can run on a subset of hardware and the first version will be released as a proof of concept. Method of distribution is still being looked into.
