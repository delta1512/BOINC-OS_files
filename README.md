# BOINCOS Repository

This repository contains the majority of files used in the BOINCOS system

## What is BOINCOS?

BOINCOS is a customised operating system tasked with the sole purpose of performing distributed/volunteer computing using the Berkley Open Infrastructure for Networked Computing [BOINC](https://boinc.berkeley.edu). BOINCOS's goal is to be run on a USB and be able to boot into any type of hardware in order to use the computer for compute tasks. It is a linux operating system built upon [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org).

**The purpose of this system is to:**

- Make the process of setting up an operating system to harbour solely BOINC computing as easy as plugging in a USB.

- Deter the usage of a proprietary and often paid solution in order to prove the versitility, simplicity and adaptability that Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) has in the modern environment. This in effect improves the user experience.

- Achieve a greater efficiency by removing the majority of the unneeded software and running processes that other solutions are bloated with, having a purely dedicated system.

## Where can I get it?

BOINCOS will at first be accessed through this repository's releases page (if possible). In the near future a bittorrent distribution method will be looked into.

BOINCOS has not been released as of yet.

## Requirements

- A desktop tower computer  

- A non-legacy (compliant with drivers) Intel, AMD or Nvidia graphics card

- At least an 8GB USB or hard drive (this size constraint may be lowered in the future)
